**Experiment 1:** Introduction to Python Programming

This is a repository that contains Jupyter Notebook code using the Python programming language. It is a set of three exercises that make use of basic Python coding and concepts.

**1. Alphabet Soup Problem:**
This is a function that takes an input from the user and outputs the characters of the inputted string into an alphabetically arranged version of the string.

• Example: "hacker" -> "acehkr"

**2. Emoticon Problem:**
This is a function that accepts user input for a sentence and replaces set words to the corresponding emoticons.

**Conversion List:**

• "smile" -> ":)"

• "grin" -> ":D"

• "sad" -> ":(("

• "mad" -> ">:("

**Example:**

• "I am mad!" -> "I am >:(!"

**3. Unpacking List Problem:**
This code divides a given list of numbers into a first part, a middle part, and a last part.

• Example: 1st = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

• First: 1, Middle: [2,3,4,5] Last: 6

**Requirements:**

• Python v.3.8 or later versions

• Jupyter Notebook

**How to Run:**

1. Download the repository or make a fork through Github.

2. Open Jupyter Notebook and upload the file (.ipynb) using the notebook.

3. Run the cells in order and input the desired user inputs in the blank boxes.
